Section: Game Setup

Define a game called "Tetris".

Create a grid with 10 columns and 20 rows.
Set each cell in the grid to be empty at the beginning.

Define a list of shapes called "Tetrominoes" containing:
    - I-shaped
    - O-shaped
    - T-shaped
    - S-shaped
    - Z-shaped
    - J-shaped
    - L-shaped

Each shape is defined by a group of four connected blocks.

Section: Game Logic

To start the Tetris game:
    Display "Welcome to Tetris! Press any key to begin."
    While the game is not over, do the following:
        - Generate a random tetromino from the list of Tetrominoes.
        - Place the tetromino at the top of the grid, centered horizontally.
        - Allow the player to move the tetromino left, right, or rotate it.
        - Move the tetromino down by one row every second.
        - If the tetromino reaches the bottom or collides with another block, lock it in place.
        - Check for any complete rows. If a row is complete, remove it and move all rows above it down by one.
        - Update the score based on the number of rows cleared.
        - If new tetromino cannot be placed at the top of the grid, end the game.

Section: Player Controls

To move the tetromino:
    If the player presses the left arrow key, move the tetromino one cell to the left.
    If the player presses the right arrow key, move the tetromino one cell to the right.
    If the player presses the up arrow key, rotate the tetromino.
    If the player presses the down arrow key, move the tetromino down faster.
    If the player presses the space bar key, move the tetromino to the bottom immediately. 

Section: Scoring System

Define the scoring system:
    - Award 100 points for each complete row cleared.
    - Award bonus points for clearing multiple rows at once:
        - 300 points for 2 rows
        - 500 points for 3 rows
        - 800 points for 4 rows (a "Tetris")

Section: Game Over

To end the game:
    Display "Game Over! Your final score is [score]."
    Ask the player if they want to play again.
    If the player chooses to play again, restart the game.
    Otherwise, thank the player for playing and end the game.

Section: Styles

Define a style called "TetrominoBlock" with the following properties:
    - Border color black
    - Border width 1 pixel
    - Background color varies by tetromino type:
        - I-shaped: cyan
        - O-shaped: yellow
        - T-shaped: purple
        - S-shaped: green
        - Z-shaped: red
        - J-shaped: blue
        - L-shaped: orange

Apply the "TetrominoBlock" style to each block in the tetromino shapes to ensure they are clearly composed of separate blocks.
