Ask the user to upload a CSV file.

Attempt to read the uploaded file as a table. If that fails, display "There was an issue reading the file. Please upload a valid CSV file."

Extract the first two columns of the table, assuming they contain labels and values.

Create a bar chart using the labels from the first column and values from the second column.

Display the bar chart to the user with the title "Data Visualization".

If there are any errors in creating the chart, display "Unable to create the bar chart. Please check the data format."
