Application: Component Demo
Create a page that shows a rich set of bootstrap inspired components.

Define the main content area:
    Add a header titled "Component Showcase".
    Below the header, create a scrollable list layout to display various styled page elements and form inputs.

    Add the following elements to the list. Add a title to each section:
        - A section with an "h1" header, "h2" subheader, and a "p" paragraph to demonstrate text styling.
        - A form with text input, email input, password input, a dropdown menu, checkboxes, and radio buttons.
        - A section with primary and secondary buttons styled using bootstrap-inspired classes.
        - An alert box styled as a success message.
        - A progress bar showing 50% completion.
        - A card with a title, text, and a footer with a link button.

Set the sidebar title to "Components" and add a detailed description of what's being shown to the sidebar.
 
Section: Layout
Create a sidebar on the left side of the screen.
Inside the sidebar, place a title aligned to the left and a toggle button aligned to the right.
When the sidebar is closed, hide the title & sidebar contents, and dock the toggle button to the far left of the screen. Leave enough space for the sidebar to be re-opened.

Create a main content area to the right of the sidebar.
Make sure the main content area takes the remaining space on the screen.

Section: Behavior
To toggle the sidebar:
    If the sidebar is open, then close it:
        Hide the title.
        Dock the toggle button to the far left of the screen, pointing right.
    Otherwise, open the sidebar:
        Show the title.
        Move the toggle button to the right side of the sidebar, pointing left.

Section: Style
Apply a "light mode" theme that's inspired by bootstrap.
Use a chevron for the sidebar toggle button.
Style the form inputs, buttons, and other elements with padding, margins, and consistent font styles.
Ensure hover and focus states are visually distinct for interactive elements.
